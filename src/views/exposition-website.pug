				p My friends at #[a(href="https://constructive.co/", target="_blank") Constructive] created a platform that brings together their many years of experience with online reports (specially for nonprofits) into a semi-turn-key digital publishing solution. From glossaries and footnotes to interactive data viz, it's a complete solution for online reports and magazines. 
				p I led the visual design of the Exposition website, which was a bit of a departure from most of the nonprofit work I do, using more of a SAAS aesthetic. The work entailed putting together a series of simple mini-icons (several of which were adapted from the excellent #[a(href="https://nucleoapp.com/", target="_blank") Nucleo] collection) as well as creating a series of nine custom illustrations to highlight the platform's features.
