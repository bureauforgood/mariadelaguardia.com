				p Derived from the Latin word for truth, the #[a(href="#") PIR] name made us think of history and permanence, story and perspective. So when we started working to develop a unifying theme and collateral for the company’s 25th annual paper show, we followed our instincts and chose to explore truth—in all of its enduring complexity and mutability—through design.
				p We developed invitations and environmental graphics for the event, as well as a keepsake book featuring 25 Chicago designers sharing their perspectives on truth. The book was a true labor of love; we customized a display typeface and short cover in Veritiv green with blind embossing and one-color letterpress. In addition to being a favorite among attendees, the book was recognized by the Type Directors Club in their 2015 typography exhibit and print annual.
