				p The #[a(href="https://www.sikhcoalition.org/", target="_blank") Sikh Coalition] works to defend Sikh civil liberties in the courtroom, classroom, community and halls of Congress. Working for #[a(href="https://constructive.co/", target="_blank") Constructive], I led the visual redesign of their website based on the information architecture developed in-house at Constructive. The starting point for the redesign was the Sikh Coalition's own brand guidelines, which specified two colors (blue and orange) and a typeface (Avenir). I selected a complementary typeface (Leitura) for their body text and titles.
