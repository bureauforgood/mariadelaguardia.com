				p Derived from the Latin word for truth, the #[a(href="#") PIR] name made us think of history and permanence, story and perspective. So when we started working to develop a unifying theme and collateral for the company’s 25th annual paper show, we followed our instincts and chose to explore truth—in all of its enduring complexity and mutability—through design.

The book was a true labor of love; we customized a display typeface and short cover in Veritiv green with blind embossing and one-color letterpress. In addition to being a favorite among attendees, the book was recognized by the Type Directors Club in their 2015 typography exhibit and print annual.
