				p PHI works to improve the quality of residential care by improving the lives of the workers who provide that care. Working for #[a(href="https://constructive.co/", target="_blank") Constructive], I led the effort to overhaul the #[a(href="https://phinational.org/", target="_blank") PHI site]'s user experience and visual design based on PHI's new understanding of their audiences, and on a recent visual rebrand.

			h2.casestudy__subhead Information Architecture
			.casestudy__body
				p PHI's work is strongly divided into three relatively siloed areas: services, policy research, and advocacy—with fairly little audience overlap. Their challenge was to make their site intuitive for these non-overlapping audiences—presenting their service pitch while simultaneously positioning themselves as a storehouse and destination for current research and data on the demographics, wages and labor conditions of care workers; and effectively advocating for improved labor practices. With 26 templates and 12 content types, including a research publications library and an interactive data center, the robust new site offers a much improved experience for both visitors and content creators.
			h2.casestudy__subhead Design
			.casestudy__body
				p Based on PHI's recent visual rebrand, my visual design approach takes a nontraditional route with a persistent, left-side, vertical navigation that uses a "drill-down" behavior—common in mobile interfaces—to help focus visitor attention at the current information level. A break-the-grid layout helps soften and add warmth to an otherwise dry content and messaging.
