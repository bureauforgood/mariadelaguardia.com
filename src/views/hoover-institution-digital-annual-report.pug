				p The Hoover Institute is a Stanford University-based libertarian think tank whose fellows have included Condolezza Rice and sitting Secretary of Defense General James Mattis among many others. Hoover approached me to design their first-ever digital annual report based on their existing print report design. From the start, we chose a single-page, long-scroll format; the challenge was to translate a 64-page print piece into an online format that could be navigable, consumable, and speak to the variety of Hoover's work. 
				p My inspiration for the interactive behavior was the celebrated long-form interactive work of the New York Timesâ€”particularly their much-lauded #[a(href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2016/12/07/world/asia/rodrigo-duterte-philippines-drugs-killings.html", target="_blank") feature] on antidrug homicides in the Philippines (warning: contains graphic images!). 
				p This project is expected to launch in early December.
